# INTRODUCTION
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major global health challenge, often diagnosed late due to its asymptomatic nature. Traditional diagnostic methods are ineffective in early detection, leading to severe health complications. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have improved CKD detection by analyzing complex medical data. This study introduces an optimized detection framework combining the Eurygasters Optimization Algorithm (EOA) with ensemble deep learning models (LSTM, BiLSTM, and BiGRU). The approach enhances feature selection, improves classification accuracy, and enables early CKD diagnosis, providing a scalable and efficient solution for healthcare systems
